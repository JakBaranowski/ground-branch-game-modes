## Contributing

You're more than welcome to clone, fork and send pull requests for this repository.
Below is more info how to set up the repo locally.

Git does not allow for cloning repositories to not empty directories, that's why you'll 
need to clone to any empty directory and then copy contents of that directory to Ground 
Branch root directory.

1. Open your prefered Git terminal (I recommend 
[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
2. Clone the repository:
    * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes.git`
    * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes.git`
3. Copy files over from the cloned repository to Ground Branch root directory
   (by default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ground Branch`).
